## IKEv2 Parser

A TypeScript parser for Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol, designed to parse, manipulate, and serialize IKEv2 packets. This parser breaks down IKEv2 messages into modular components, including headers, payloads, transforms, and proposals, for detailed inspection and modification.

### Features

• Parsing of IKEv2 Packets: Parse incoming IKEv2 packets into a readable structure.

• Modular Architecture: Separate classes for headers, payloads, transforms, and proposals for ease of use and extension.

• Serialization: Convert structured IKEv2 data back into its original binary format for transmission.
